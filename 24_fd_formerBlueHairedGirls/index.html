        <p>It all began one Wednesday evening. Logan, Maya's 16 month old brother, had been having sleeping problems for weeks. This night, it was worse than ever. Logan had had a mid day -- his lunch ws the blueberry gurber mix instead of strawberry, and his guardians had not played cocomelon when he demanded it. As he attempted to fall asleep, he wailed, endlessly into the night, not comforted by his also mid duckies in his crib. The next morning, Logan's parents, weary from a night of tortured screams, bought Logan a new Ducky -- Bulbasaur (not to be confused with bubble store, Logan's favorite place to visit. It was love at first sight. Bulbasaur's green complexion had an immensely calming effect on Logan. That night, he slept like a baby. </p>
